# YEA Personal Campaign Pages

Custom behaviors for YEA on Personal Campaign Pages.

## Custom behaviors
This extension changes behavior of Personal Campaign Pages in the following ways:

* Custom colors for campaign progress "thermometer" to match YEA branding.
* On every Personal Campaign Page, above the Personal Campaign Pages's intro 
  text, inject the intro text for the parent contribution page.
* Hide the "Create your own fundraising page" link on child PCP pages.
* Adjust "N% to our goal" text placement so that it never falls below thermometer
  placement.
* On the PCP setup form: hide the "Welcome" field, and require the "Your Message"
  field.
